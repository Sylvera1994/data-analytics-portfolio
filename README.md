# 📊 Sylvera Okoro — Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio!  
I am a Financial Services Relationship Manager transitioning into Data Analytics after several years of working with data-driven tasks such as financial analysis, customer portfolio reporting, performance tracking, and insights generation.

Over time, my work in the banking sector exposed me to the power of data.  
From analyzing customer performance to preparing management reports and identifying business opportunities, I discovered that data analytics is not just a tool — it is my passion.

This portfolio showcases hands-on projects using:

- SQL  
- Excel  
- Tableau  
- Python  
- Data Visualization
